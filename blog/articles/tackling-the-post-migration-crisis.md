# Tackling the Post-Migration Crisis: The Story Behind Eden's Data Solution

At Eden, we're obsessed with the complexities of the data tech stack. It's been described to us as a mangled ball of duct tape, something you shove into an imaginary technical closet and hope for the best — a chaotic maze where nothing connects properly, and every decision feels like a workaround. In some ways, it's a beautiful mess — proof of the artistry that goes into building a company in the digital age. But what drives us is the belief that engineers should be focused on innovation, not solving infrastructure challenges that often lead to huge retention issues, even at the largest companies. That's the philosophy behind Eden — to build a product that elevates the most painful part of the tech stack, allowing engineers to do what they do best.

So, what did engineers tell us was the most painful part of their work? What happens to their data after a migration. It all comes down to the core mission behind Eden — moving data seamlessly between systems. This challenge is often seen as inevitable, costly, and time-consuming. But after a year of research, we were convinced there had to be a better way.

What we found is that the database migration landscape is broken. Businesses in highly regulated industries have to halt everything to migrate data, often facing long delays, expensive infrastructure changes, and rewriting massive portions of app code. This reality wasn't just frustrating—it was keeping companies from scaling.

## The Problem We Wanted to Solve

The issue wasn't just about moving data, it was about how we approach the entire process. Every existing solution required extensive rewrites of applications and long delays due to the heavy lifting involved in moving data. We spoke with businesses and consultants who were forced to rewrite vast portions of their apps just to migrate data from one database to another. For them, database migrations were not only costly, they were a bottleneck to productivity.

This was a huge opportunity for us to rethink the process and design a solution that would change everything.

## How Eden Solves the Database Migration Problem

Eden's innovation lies in **zero-copy architecture**, which eliminates the need for app code rewrites during database migrations. This means businesses can migrate data seamlessly, without expensive infrastructure changes or delays. With Eden, companies can continue to operate normally while migrating their data—no interruptions, no downtime.

Our solution allows businesses to access data in real time, without having to completely overhaul their infrastructure. Eden is designed for scalability, supporting both cloud and on-prem environments. And it doesn't stop there… Eden is also designed to enable real-time data access and AI readiness, allowing businesses to support intelligent workflows like semantic caching and vector-based retrieval.

By solving the core pain point of database migrations, we've created a solution that helps businesses scale faster and more securely, all while avoiding the traditional headaches.

## The Road to Eden: Where It All Began

The idea for Eden took shape over a simple conversation. After our time in college, Devon (CTO) was tackling a technical challenge so profound that it stalled the development of his first company. As we discussed the issue of siloed data, it became clear that the ability to access data across systems—without rewriting app code—was a game-changer.

This was more than a technical issue; it was an opportunity to build a solution that could help businesses scale faster without the cost and complexity of traditional migration methods.

## The Impact of Eden

Since launching Eden, we've received incredible feedback from our early users. They've helped us refine our product and understand exactly what businesses need to scale without disruption. What excites us most is the potential for Eden to evolve into a full platform that empowers businesses to scale their data infrastructure without the usual headaches.

With Eden, we're not just solving the database migration problem — we're providing a fast, scalable, and secure solution that businesses can trust, even as they integrate AI-powered workflows and real-time data access into their systems.

## What's Next for Eden

Looking ahead, we're focused on scaling Eden even further. We'll continue to improve our AI integration, real-time data workflows, and overall user experience. Our mission is to be the go-to solution for businesses that need to seamlessly scale their data infrastructure.

With the support of our incredible early partners and investors, Eden is on track to change the way businesses handle data migration. We're excited to continue building momentum and solving data challenges for businesses across industries.
